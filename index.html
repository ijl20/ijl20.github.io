<p>
  Systems is one of the largest and longest standing research areas in the
  Computer Laboratory, covering hardware, communications hardware and
  software, operating systems and distributed systems. Systems
  developed here include:

  These pages are in the process of being updated. Details of ongoing
  research, student projects, and the like will be added here in due course.
  Until then, the most recent capture of such information will be on the
  <a href="netos/">NetOS</a> pages.

<h2>Subdivision &amp; Reformation</h2>
<p>
  The SRG occasionally spontaneously subdivides and reforms, a process which
  sometimes results in other research groups spinning out. Recent subgroups
  that are now largely dormant include:

    <p>
      The name was chosen to have a multimedia feel and the mnemonic may be
      expanded to &#8220;objects, persistence, events, replication and activity&#8221;.
      The thrust is open distributed processing with an object orientated
      approach. We look to support emerging distributed applications in
      which users and devices may be mobile and may have multimedia
      presentation requirements. Current themes are asynchronous (event)
      extensions to synchronous middleware and an access control
      architecture, Oasis. The projects and publications links below lead
      to fuller information about this and other work in the group.
